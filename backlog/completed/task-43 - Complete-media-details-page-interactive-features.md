## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add interactive functionality to the media details page to enable full management of media items, episodes, files, and downloads.

The media details page (task-39) provides a solid viewing foundation, but several interactive features are currently placeholders or missing:

## Features to Implement

1. **Manual Search Integration** - Connect the manual search button to indexers/search system
2. **Quality Profile Editing** - Build the edit form in the placeholder modal
3. **Cast and Crew Display** - Show cast/crew from metadata
4. **Episode Actions** - Add per-episode management (toggle monitoring, search)
5. **Media File Management** - Delete, mark preferred, view details
6. **Download Management** - Retry, cancel, remove, view details

This task consolidates all remaining interactive features needed to make the details page fully functional.
